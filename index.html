          Small dog breeds have been bred for their compact, manageable size. In
          some cases, their petite size benefitted their working or hunting
          ability, while in other cases, they were simply desirable as lap dogs
          and all-around endearing little companions. Small dogs are generally
          easy to transport, and they typically have lower food and medication
          costs than large breeds. Plus, many small dog breeds do well in homes
          with limited space.

          Flat-faced dogs with wrinkles require special facial care. Otherwise
          easy-to-groom breeds, like scenthounds, often have a distinct hound
          scent that some people cannot tolerate without bathing their dog once
          a week. In addition, some of the easiest-to-groom breeds are also
          major shedders. Not included in this list are heavy shedders,
          droolers, very large dogs, wrinkly dogs, longhaired dogs, oily-coated
          dogs, and dogs with a hound smell.
